Netflix Movie Recommendation System Project

This project focuses on building a recommendation system using collaborative filtering. Key aspects include:

 - Data analysis of Netflix's movie ratings, customer activity, and movie ratings distribution
 - Data preparation for collaborative filtering by handling least-rated movies and least-active customers
 - Secondary data integration to enhance recommendations
 - Model building for generating movie recommendations based on customer preferences
   
This project applies various filtering techniques and modeling approaches to refine and improve recommendation accuracy.
